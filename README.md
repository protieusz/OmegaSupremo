# OmegaSupremo
Budget version of OmegaSupreme. A total of 26 through hole GPIO pins are broken out and 4 GPIO pins are reserved for MOSI, MISO, CS, SCK for the trackball sensor, PMW3360. PER56 encoder is integrated to the pcb. PCB diameter is 65mm. Core components and pcb shape are heavily modded from AriaMelon's Kiwano trackball module and jfedor2 RP2040+PMW3360 trackball module. Wire for the daughterboard connection i.e. 5v, D-, D+, GND will need to be wire swap during design keyboard PCB around the OmegaSupremo. Daughterboard can be connected via onboard JSH 4 pin connector or straight 4 through holes.  In order for this PCB to work you would either need to design your own that has a Fuse, 2 x 5.1K resistors & a USB C port or use a existing C3 usb C daughterboard. PCB has not been printed nor tested. Print as your own risk and no support will be given.
